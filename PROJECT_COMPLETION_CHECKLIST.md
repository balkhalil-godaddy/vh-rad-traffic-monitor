## Notes

- Each checkbox represents a discrete task that can be assigned and tracked
- Tasks within a phase can often be parallelized among team members
- Regular code reviews should be conducted after each phase
- Consider creating feature branches for each phase
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition periods
